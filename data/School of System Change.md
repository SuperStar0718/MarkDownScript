## Body

In a world on the brink of collapse, changing so fast and yet in many ways not fast enough, we need broad and deep systems change. The School of System Change exists to nurture the work of leaders and changemakers who are embracing complexity and bringing about hopeful futures.

We create pathways from overwhelm to agency.

The School of System Change is unique in our multi-method approach to learning, recognising there is no one way to create change but a wealth of tools and frameworks to choose from. 

Discernment is a key capacity for our times.

Our inspiring contributors and talented facilitators from across the field of systems change share a passion for supporting people to navigate different ways of thinking, acting and being as we develop our collective capacity for transformation. Together, we contribute to evolving the field and practices of systems change.

## key People

Anna Birney, CEO

## Theory of change

"Learning is change."

The ongoing process of learning through adapting to constantly evolving conditions inherently dismantles the domainant paradigm of imperialist, white-surpremacist, capitalist patriarchy.

This work is difficult and requires sustained cultures and structures for collective learning connected to the broader context.

We train people to build those cultures and structures.
