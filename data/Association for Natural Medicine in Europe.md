## Body

"The Association for Natural Medicine in Europe e.V. (ANME) operates as a democratic, non-governmental organization. Our mission is based on preserving intangible cultural heritage (ICH), and we are committed to a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach to health and health-related politics and dialogue via both national and inter-European engagement.

ANME works on behalf of complementary and alternative medicine and traditional naturopathy (CAM) in Europe. We encourage education, discussion, and action to aid in the continued and increased access to CAM. ANME focuses on the well-being of humans and animals, and we do so with an interest to also maintain, sustain, and improve the safety of and standards for our environment, medicines, and planet."
