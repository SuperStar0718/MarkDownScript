### Close to: 
  
### curator: 
  Catherine
### Notes/comments/questions: 
  8. not super obviously 2R but treating health in a holistic way (people and planet health intertiwned) and preserving different cultures and traditions and forms of knowledge when it comes to health and wellbeing. not sure whether territory should be regenerative alternatives or personal healing... since it's about health but not necessarily primarily inner dimension

Our mission is based on preserving intangible cultural heritage (ICH), and we are committed to a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach to health and health-related politics and dialogue via both national and inter-European engagement.

We encourage education, discussion, and action to aid in the continued and increased access to CAM. ANME focuses on the well-being of humans and animals, and we do so with an interest to also maintain, sustain, and improve the safety of and standards for our environment, medicines, and planet."
