## Body

"We are activists, social entrepreneurs, foundation staff, and philanthropists working towards systemic change in philanthropy.

Our goal is to contribute to a philanthropic sector that shares power, to support systems transformation in a radically transparent way. Experiments are Leapâ€™s method of disruption and creation in philanthropy. We seek out important projects that need, but do not receive, funding, and help connect them with resources, people and institutions."
