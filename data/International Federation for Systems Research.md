### Notes/comments/questions: 
  6. believe we need new ways of thinking to respond to the challenges of the Anthropocene but systems/outer focus. Propose new territory: systems thinking/complexity/polycrisis. See map territories tab. could almost be metacrisis, but it's more polycrisis - looking at the interconnected crises but not so much deeper cultural/spiritual core
