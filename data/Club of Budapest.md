## Body

"Founded in 1993, the Club of Budapest is an informal international association dedicated to developing a new way of thinking and a new ethics that will help resolve the social, political, economic, and ecological challenges of the 21st century. With its roster of internationally renowned members, the Club initiates a dialogue between different belief systems and worldviews in order to co-create and develop effective strategies for responsible and sustainable action with a global focus."

"The Mission of the Club of Budapest is to be a catalyst for the transformation to a sustainable world through promoting the emergence of planetary consciousness and interconnecting generations and cultures. The philosophy of the Club of Budapest is based on the realization that the enormous challenges that humanity is currently facing can only be overcome through the development of a global cultural consciousness with a global perspective.

The Club perceives itself as a builder of bridges between science and art, ethics and economy, between old and young, as well as between the different cultures of the world. One of the prime objectives of the work of the Club is the initiative "You can Change the World"."
