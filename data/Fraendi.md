### description: 
  "Frændi is a group of consulting professionals, thinkers, educators, doers, and optimists who are committed to the practice of unlocking potential—in people, teams, systems, and organizations.

Our goal is to instill confidence in individuals, leaders, governments, and organizations and together help create a roadmap to a prosperous, planet-sustaining future.

In a world that faces unprecedented challenges from social justice to environmental degradation, Frændi is working with leaders who are moving their organizations forward with clarity, confidence, empathy, agility, and resilience.

We are working with a number of developmental lenses and scientific methodologies that support leaders, teams, and organisations as they navigate through these disruptive times.

In working with people, we observe thinking patterns and capacities to relate to others. This supports their ability to perceive their own developmental edges, learn how to influence situations, and ultimately become part of the solutions we need.

Through a combination of cognitive and worldview profiles, consulting, coaching and leadership development, Fraendi unlocks the potential to drive paradigm-shifting change."
