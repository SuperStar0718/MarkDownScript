### description: 
  "Trans4m is a passionate enabler of individual and collective transformation processes. We address the burning issues of our time, releasing individual and collective genius. 

At its core, Trans4m is a catalyst of a new integral theory and practice, supporting individuals, organisations, communities and societies to engage in carefully designed transformative processes, in order to develop their full potential and to contribute, in a sustainable and life-affirming way, to the development of humanity.

Trans4m sees itself as an integral response to a “world on fire” – a world that is facing massive socio-ecological-economic-spiritual imbalances that altogether threaten the very existence of people and planet."
