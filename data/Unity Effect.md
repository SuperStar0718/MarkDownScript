### description: 
  "We are a social enterprise who works with a network of freelancers, guided by our purpose of leading from the inside out. Our team structures are based on principles of self-organisation, shared leadership, transparency and continuous learning. In our team culture as well as our collaborations, we value showing up as whole humans, in balance with efficient and effective work. We work in English and German.

Since 2017, we’ve been working together with purpose-driven leaders, organisations, foundations and networks who are contributing to a more sustainable, just and thriving world. Some are building their own companies, others are intrapreneurs making an impact within purpose-driven organisations, foundations and networks, while others are about to begin their journey towards purposeful work."
