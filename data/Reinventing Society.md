### description: 
  "Reinventing Society is a non-profit and independent think tank founded in late 2020. Our mission is to accompany people into a regenerative society. To do this, we develop positive visions of the future , accompany change processes and impart future skills. We see our organization itself as a real-world laboratory in which new empirical knowledge is created.

Our team consists of economists and social scientists, sustainability and environmental researchers, experts from communication and media, psychology and politics.

Our perspective on social change is holistic and includes the three levels of individual, organization and society. With a systemic view, we make interactions visible and develop realistic solutions depending on the situation and overall context. We combine a playful attitude with professional expertise and human depth.

We are in a phase of great upheaval. Various crises lead to the end of old structures. We sense that something new wants to be created. Our work is dedicated to the creation of a new world, a world of beauty, regeneration, connection and vitality."
