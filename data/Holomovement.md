##Body

The Holomovement is a social movement that awakens us to our interconnectedness, igniting a critical mass of collaborative action serving the good of the whole. 

We are a global community of innovators, change-makers, compassionate individuals, businesses and nonprofits drawn to creating a better world. The Holomovement is ALL OF US.
‍
While there are stewards supporting the movement, there are no boards or governing bodies holding ownership of the Holomovement itself. 

The Holomovement is an experiment in joyful collaboration--a named space for coalition and shared collective wisdom--rather than a non-profit or organizational entity.
