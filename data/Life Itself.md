### description: 
  "We are pragmatic utopians, committed to practical action for a radically wiser, weller world. We create coliving hubs, start businesses, do research and engage in activism to pioneer a wiser culture. We are ordinary people who choose an extra-ordinary path, treading the middle way between Plum Village and Silicon Valley. [...]

Real change requires us to work, and even live, together – hence creating co-living spaces and businesses; and to share ideas through writing and events, ultimately engaging in politics and social change. [...]

We balance the spiritual and the rational. We like meditation as much as we like getting things done. We want meaningful work and a meaningful life. We value the environment and technology, art and science. We take action, both personal and political. We’re the middle way between the suit and the hippy, between the billionaire and the monk.[...]

Our team consists of artists, researchers, technologists and community builders. Despite these varied backgrounds, each shares a commitment to being wise and taking practical action to solve the collective challenges facing our society and culture."
