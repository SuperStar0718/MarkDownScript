### description: 
  "Terra Meera is a newly founded Center for Regeneration and Human Potential, born in Croatia. Located in an abandoned valley, Terra Meera pioneers are laying the foundations for a community project dedicated to local and regenerative agriculture in the area.

This campaign will plant a biodiverse and native fruit forest, revitalise the Terra Meera land, support the local economy and create a source of food and educational opportunities for local and international communities."
