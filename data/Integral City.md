##Body

"Integral City Meshworks is a global constellation of communities of practice that nurtures cities as human hives. Launched in 2005, and now in Canada, USA, UK, Netherlands, Spain, Russia, Mexico, Australia and South Africa, we connect the 4 Voices of the city to energize relationships, that unify visions and develop eco-regional resilience strategies for hive wellbeing. Through placecaring and placemaking we inspire a Planet of Integral Cities as living, integral, evolutionary human systems, to become Gaiaâ€™s Reflective Organs."

"An Integral City paradigm views the city as a whole living system. It is the Human Hive. Like the beehive is for the species of the honey bee, the Integral City is the collective habitat for the human species.

An Integral City integrates qualities that create optimal conditions for human innovation and emergence and eco-regional resilience."
