  A Mighty Network community.

"Welcome to the Deep Transformation Network. If you care about helping shift our civilization toward a flourishing future, this is YOUR network!

By joining, you become part of an online community of open-hearted, caring, people from around the world who recognize that our civilization is in existential crisis—and who want to engage with others in facilitating a deep transformation toward a life-affirming future on a regenerated Earth.

This is a public network, welcoming people from diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultural traditions. It’s free for everyone, and will be funded on a donation basis.

Here’s a summary of who we are:

Identity | We are a community sharing deep concern about our civilization’s direction, with an intention to engage constructively to change its trajectory.

Purpose | To help amplify the forces for Deep Transformation that could set humanity on a path of future flourishing on a regenerated Earth.

Values | With reverence for the dignity and interdependence of all beings, we seek life-enriching symbioses within human society and within the planetary matrix that sustains us all."
