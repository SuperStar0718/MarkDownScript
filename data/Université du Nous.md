### description: 
  "The University of Us is a world to discover, to meet. It is a unique journey of pioneers of doing things together, of sensitivity, of the common. It is a handful of committed, fiery utopians, convinced of a possible "other tomorrow".

Since 2010, the Université du Nous has been reinventing "doing together" through its own experience of cooperation and collective intelligence, and finds its purpose in transmitting its learning to those who also want to take this path, driven by a deep desire (and hope) for societal transition.

A civic organization, it is also a place for research, experimentation, creation and sharing of commons on new ways of doing things together. It questions, tests, and kneads everything that revolves around collective intelligence, shared governance and the exercise of power in a relationship of equivalence, but also our relationship to money, learning through a so-called "sensitive" pedagogy (heart/body/mind) or even the question of gender..."
