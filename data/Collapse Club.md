## Body

"How are we to live in the time of collapse?

Do you feel alone and isolated with your knowledge of collapse? Do your family and friends not understand what you're seeing and feeling? In a Collapse Club meeting, you will join like-minded people in a safe, structured space to discuss your concerns about our worldâ€™s converging crises. [...]

We hold three meetings per week, on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. You are welcome at any or all. Meetings are free and without obligation."

An Online Community: Providing continuing connection and ongoing dialogue among members. (Visit our Facebook Group.)
