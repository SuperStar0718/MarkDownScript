### description: 
  "Our education needs a new story – just like our society, in which education plays a key role. With our current systems, we are failing people, nature, the planet. We live in a time in which we are searching for new answers together, in line with the knowledge, insights and awareness that we now have.

We realize that we ourselves – parents, students, teachers, school leaders, administrators and others in and around education – must be the change that we would like to see in the world, in our education. We are going on a journey. Each of us on our own and we together with and for each other.

We are – Operation Education."
