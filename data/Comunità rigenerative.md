### description: 
  "We co-create multiple cells of resilience. We rebuild communities in alpine hamlets, both those completely abandoned and those still partially alive. We are working to repopulate fields of food and hope, recovered from brambles and collapsed walls, and houses lost to neglect. We are in places of rebirth and regeneration where we have already begun to live as if the world of our dreams were already here. We rebuild communities, creating food, energy, social self-sufficiency. There is no more time to waste if we are to begin to live truly in harmony with the planet and each other. Doing it together is our only hope."
