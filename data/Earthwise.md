## Body

"EARTHwise is a visionary movement and ecosystem for a thrivable world and future. Founded in 2015 through EARTHwise Centre, it champions personal, collective, and systemic transformation to shift trajectories from collapse to collective thriving. Building the foundations and movement for a new and planetary civilization, in partnership with life.

The EARTHwise platform leads in regenerative economics, global governance, education, system design, responsible stewardship of AGI development, and innovative game development for current and future generations.

The name “EARTHwise” means to become wise like the Earth, and to act in harmony with the evolutionary principles of our planet. [...]

Thrivability as Our Focus
Life on planet Earth is radically shifting in ways we're not prepared for. The EARTHwise Constitution for a Planetary Civilization is our North Star for how we grow our ecosystem and navigate through these challenging times. EARTHwise offers transformative solutions based on the evolutionary  principles and intelligence of living systems. 

With thrivability as our focus we go further than mere sustainability. Thrivability is a creative process for developing our capacities and actualizing our potentials in ways that are generative, life-affirming, and future creative."
