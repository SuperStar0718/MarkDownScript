## Body

"in.Seed is a multidisciplinary design and consulting workshop serving integrated projects. [...]

Integrated systems design: the basis of our activity lies in offering complete design services and subsequent monitoring. Our role is to crystallize the client's ideas into a systemic and integrated vision. Based on this vision, we develop tailor-made organizational and management strategies, technologies, architecture and space planning best suited to meet local needs, systematically enabling quality, value. and the resonance of the entire ecosystem.

Group support and facilitation: We also offer support and facilitation for groups in their different phases of project creation (co-living environments, for example). We share our outside perspective and expertise on certain areas to guide the group towards an overall vision of what their project could look like.

Reflections, events and projects around the notion of place of emergence: Our projects such as L'Arbre qui Pousse, the Germoir des Fontaines and the Schumacher Sprouts have led us to reflections on the concept of place of emergence, which also becomes part of our mission within our activity. Thus, we organize meetings, conferences, events around the question of our environments and our habitat of tomorrow."
