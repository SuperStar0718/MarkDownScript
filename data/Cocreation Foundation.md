## Body

"The Cocreation Foundation is a think and do tank to understand, forward and prototype cocreation as a cultural technique to tackle the global challenges of our time.

Moving through the great transformation, we strive to design new code for a cocreative global governance.

It is our conviction that we need this new governance code to face the challenge of cocreating a world for 10-12 billion people living in peace, freedom and ecological abundance on this earth."
