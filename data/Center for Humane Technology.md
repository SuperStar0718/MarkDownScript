## Body

"Together with our partners, the Center for Humane Technology (CHT) is dedicated to radically reimagining our digital infrastructure. Our mission is to drive a comprehensive shift toward humane technology that supports our well-being, democracy, and shared information environment.

From the dinner table to the corner office to the halls of government, our work mobilizes millions of advocates, technologists, business leaders, and policymakers through media campaigns, working groups, and high-level briefings."
