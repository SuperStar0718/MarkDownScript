## Body

"We are a small emergent collective dedicated to supporting the inner-led change needed to challenge systemic injustice and support outer social and ecological change and deep cultural transformation. We do this by supporting people, groups and organisations to compost power-over culture from the inside-out.

It is palpable that the effectiveness of our outer actions depends on us engaging in inner practices that support us to expand our consciousness beyond right/wrong binaries - and the power-over culture and drama triangle consciousness this polarising mind-set perpetuates. Without changing our inner worlds our change-efforts simply replicate the power-over paradigm that created our current crises. It is the tending of this threshold between the inner and outer dimensions of change that Starter Culture is bringing to the conversation about systemic change."
