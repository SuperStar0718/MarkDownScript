### description: 
  "Systemic Justice is a new NGO that partners with organisations working on racial, social, and economic justice to bring about change through strategic litigation.

We are the first organisation in Europe that works with community partners on strategic litigation by taking a community-driven, intersectional approach, and that: 

- is Black-led 
- has a majority BPOC team 

Systemic Justice was founded by human rights lawyer Nani Jansen Reventlow who is specialised in strategic litigation at the intersection of human rights, social justice, and technology."
