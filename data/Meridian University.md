## Body

"Founded over 30 years ago in the San Francisco Bay Area, Meridian University enrolls students globally in its unique hybrid and 100% online graduate degree, professional certificate, and public programs. The University offers master's and doctoral programs in Business, Education, Leadership, and Psychology with diverse concentrations available within each of these programs. Meridian’s integrated, innovative curriculum is designed to be experiential and transformative.

Meridian graduates are engaged in varied professional contexts that include coaching, psychotherapy, organizational development, facilitation, social healing, social entrepreneurship, and transformative leadership.

Meridian’s graduate programs are available in two formats, hybrid and 100% online. This model supports students who are working professionals and balancing other life commitments to move forward towards their personal and professional future.

Meridian is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission and approved by the US Department of Education for participation in the Federal Student Aid program. WASC is the Department of Education-recognized regional accreditor for such schools as the University of California at Berkeley, UCLA, and Stanford University. Meridian’s licensable degrees have been recognized by the California Board of Behavioral Sciences and Board of Psychology for over 25 years

Vision and Mission
The evolution of human beings expresses the earth’s deepest potentials. The term Meridian evokes and symbolizes the earth as inhabited and imagined by humans. The culture that humans have imagined into being is in urgent need of transformation. The professions of Business, Education, Leadership, and Psychology can serve to make a critical contribution to contemporary possibilities for the transformation of culture. Meridian University’s curriculum takes an integrative approach to both personal and cultural transformation within organizations, communities, and societies.

Guided by an Integral Vision, Meridian University seeks to educate leaders with the capacities, skills, and knowledge essential for transforming the professions of Business, Education, Leadership, and Psychology. The leadership capacities of courage, compassion, clarity, conscience, and embodied self-awareness, together constitute the wisdom and integrity required for transforming the professions and the wider culture. Transformative learning at Meridian catalyzes the emergence of these capacities which, along with developing creative inquiry skills and acquiring professional knowledge, actualizes Meridian’s commitment to sustaining an education that transforms.

Meridian’s commitment to public and professional engagement is developed through the Center for Transformative Learning."
