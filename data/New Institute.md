## Body

"On the basis of humanistic and social-scientific reflection, THE NEW INSTITUTE aims to develop visions of progressive socio-economic and political futures.  All of our activities are clustered around three Research Areas: The Human Condition in the 21st Century, The Future of Democracy, and Socio-Economic Transformation. An annual theme provides focus across these areas, and structures our research activities, fellowship programs, lectures, and workshops.

Fellowships are primarily granted to research groups headed by program chairs. These groups address specific problems within The Human Condition in the 21st Century, The Future of Democracy, and Socio-Economic Transformation. Individual fellowships are also offered.

We live and work in the Warburg Ensemble, a series of 19th century townhouses that provide the conditions for hosting up to 35 fellows to work on collaborative projects. In addition to residential units, there are rooms for individual and group work, areas for public events, common dining rooms, a library, a public book store, an artistsâ€™ studio, and a garden."
