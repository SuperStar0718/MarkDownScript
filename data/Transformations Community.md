"We are a global community of action-oriented researchers and reflective practitioners who support transformations to a sustainable and regenerative future.

"Our Mission

To increase people’s capacity to transform social-ecological systems to achieve desirable futures that are sustainable, regenerative, just, and equitable by rapidly co-creating and amplifying knowledge, capacities, learning and action."
