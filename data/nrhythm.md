### description: 
  "Through a living systems approach, nRhythm is on a mission to transform workplaces and create conditions where health and abundance are the natural outcomes.

We offer various educational offerings, free resources, gatherings, community, plus consulting for brands, organizations, businesses, and projects. 

With only 13% of people engaged at work, let's face it--how we manage and design organizations simply is not working. We've been treating organizations as if they are machines, pushing productivity and efficiency at the expense of long-term health. In this model, humans are resources that must be aligned on an org chart -- like cogs in a machine. But organizations are not machines. 

Organizations are complex living systems. And living systems require a very different management and design approach.

nRhythm helps organizations make the necessary shifts in their design and operations to align with a living systems approach. We call organizations who embrace this approach Regenerative Organizations."
