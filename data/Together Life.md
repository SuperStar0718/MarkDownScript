### description: 
  "The Together organization was established out of the understanding that there are millions of organizations and people around the world working to create a change for the better. However, we understand that in order to create a significant change, we need to unite and operate together, rather than each operate independently.

Together Movement, as its name implies – is a home that connects and provides a platform for all these organizations and people, to be able to work together for the purpose of creating the longed-for change. [...]

The organization operates simultaneously in two areas:

A. Consciousness – Creating individual change and expansion of consciousness,  leading to a new balanced and healthy state of consciousness, both to the individual and the collective.

B. Systems – Creating new systems that work for the people in the main areas of life. This includes Economy, Health, Education, Media & Communication, Lands and communities, Sustainability and more."
