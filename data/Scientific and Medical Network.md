### description: 
  "For fifty years, the Scientific and Medical Network has been bringing together individuals – including professionals with a background in science, medicine, engineering, psychology, philosophy and complementary practices – who accept the existence of a fundamental, unifying and transcendent reality.

Given the current divisive and disconnected state of the world, we maintain that there is a pressing need for a worldview that goes beyond the prevailing materialist ethos and provides the rising generation with an orienting sense of meaning and purpose.

We thus feel it more important than ever to affirm our original transformative aim of promoting humanity’s spiritual essence as compatible with enlightened scientific thinking.

Through our extensive educational programme, featuring internationally renowned speakers and visionaries in their respective fields, we provide a creative forum for exploring frontier issues at the interfaces between science, spirituality, consciousness and well-being.

In a spirit of open and critical enquiry, we seek to integrate ‘heart’ and ‘head’ – connecting intuitive insights with evidence-based reason."
