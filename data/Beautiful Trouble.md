### description: 
  "Beautiful Trouble is… 
A book, strategy card deck, online toolbox and creative campaign incubator.
An international network of artist-activist-trainers helping grassroots movements become more creative and effective. [...]

We believe in people power and the game-changing role that creativity, humor, joy, and mischief can play in the struggle for a better world. We practice shared leadership, modified consensus-based decision making, anti-oppression politics, and international and intersectional solidarity. [...]

We are a global network of organizers, artists, trainers, and writers who form the community of praxis called Beautiful Trouble. [...]

We equip social movements with an ever-growing suite of strategic tools and training to help grassroots movements be more creative, effective, and irresistible."
