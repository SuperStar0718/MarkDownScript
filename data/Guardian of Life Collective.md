### Notes/comments/questions: 
  hard to get a sense of what they're really actually doing. Nice ideas and language though... "We are looking to tackle the deeper root cause - the mindset and culture that create and develop any manmade system". 5. Sound very aligned, but just don't get a concrete sense of what they're doing.

### description: 
  "Guardian of Life collaborates through collective action of its networks, loosely interdependent and independent, united in diversity through Guardian of Life essence. It is not a process as most humans have understood it to be in this present time. It's an embodied / immersive / experiential living system process where the process is not in the system but in the being of the person (also a living system / nature). [...]

For this collaboration to be deeply meaningful, we explore together how to move our hearts, minds and hands for collective action. This is supported by the practical realisation of our collaborations through experimentation and prototyping of independent and interdependent initiatives, based on timeless and modern knowledge, and time tested tools.

This culture allows for designing systems, processes and governance that is true and of integrity to living systems: co-creating conditions from all living forms to thrive and live as an organism rather than individual entities.

From this essence we can then experiment to act locally, connect and collaborate regionally and learn globally (through online and offline platforms), finding a multitude of unique and regional ways on how live in emergence and as a living organism.

LIVING MISSION
Through deep listening and nature-connection, we co-create a regenerative culture of care, learning and celebration that embodies interdependency and values meaningful connection."
