### Notes/comments/questions: 
  Have the feeling of "I've seen it before" in terms of emerging networks with a particular culture finding themselves. There is an intrigueing flavor here for me - they seem to be developing what they're preaching. I'd have to participate to find out.

I thought this was really cool - they seem to offer a guided onboarding experience. You present an offer or request you have, pay 55 euro, and they match you with someone who helps you activate the network around your request:
