## Body

"The MIND Foundation envisions a healthier, more connected world through evidence-based, safe, and legal applications of the psychedelic experience.

- We support and conduct high-quality psychedelic research.
- We translate science into everyday language to support people in living healthy and meaningful lives.
- We work with policymakers to create safe and legal environments for the psychedelic experience.
- We train professionals and educate the public on psychedelic treatments, integration, evidence-based harm reduction, and human development.
- We encourage communities to build beneficial, knowledge-based, and risk-aware attitudes around psychedelics.

The MIND Foundation is a European non-profit registered under German law (HRB 220247 B). [...]

At the MIND Foundation, we navigate the intersection of human development, mental health, and sustainability through a unique framework anchored in the concept of Bewusstseinskultur, or "culture of consciousness." This approach, developed by neurophilosopher Thomas Metzinger, blends critical thinking, meditation, and psychedelic practices into a practical ethos for individual and societal transformation. 

In order to place psychedelics in the center of society, we strongly believed that we had to pursue the medical model, hence becoming a key partner in Europe’s largest psilocybin study for treatment resistant depression (TRD) and opening Germany’s first augmented psychotherapy clinic. 

Now, our goal is to cultivate human flourishing by connecting psychological well-being with sociocultural progress."
