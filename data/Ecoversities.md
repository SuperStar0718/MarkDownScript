### description: 
  "ecoversities: learners and communities reclaiming diverse knowledges, relationships and imaginations to design new approaches to higher education. 

The Ecoversities Alliance is committed to radically re-imagining higher education to cultivate human and ecological flourishing. Ecoversities seek to transform the unsustainable and unjust economic, political and social systems/mindsets that dominate the planet. The Ecoversities Alliance is a trans-local community of over 200 transformative learning spaces from around the world who have been meeting and working together since 2015 through international and regional gatherings, learning exchanges, mutual aid campaigns, workshops, collaborative projects, learning journeys, film festivals and publications."
