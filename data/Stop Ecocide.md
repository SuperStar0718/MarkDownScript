### description: 
  "'Ecocide' is a word to describe what is happening to our planet; the mass damage and destruction of the natural living world.  It literally means “killing one’s home”.   And right now, in most of the world, no-one is held responsible.  

It’s time to change the rules.  It’s time to protect our home.

We are working, together with a growing global network of lawyers, diplomats, and across all sectors of civil society, towards making ecocide an international crime."
