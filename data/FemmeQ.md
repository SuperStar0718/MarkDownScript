## Body

"FemmeQ: Feminine Intelligence is a global movement launched in 2016, when 140 people from 15 countries gathered in Berlin. 

The FemmeQ concept was founded by Dr Scilla Elworthy, Alexandra Feldner and Karen Downes, together have distilled the wisdom from heart centred business leaders, spiritual teachers and activists to offer you the direct way to integrate this deep feminine wisdom. 

FemmeQ is the indispensable wisdom that empowers us to create compassionate dialogue, to nurture rather than destroy and regenerate rather than deplete.

The conscious activation of FEMMEQ is essential for the future of humanity. This wisdom has been marginalised for centuries and is now rising to its full expression to shape a new world."

"OUR PURPOSE
To amplify the voices of women and empower those who are applying feminine intelligence to catalyse the transformation needed to create a flourishing future for all.

WHAT WE ARE DOING
We are connecting to strengthen our resolve, collaborating to broaden our reach, celebrating the progress made, and deepening our commitment to play our role in bringing about a cultural revolution and systemic shift essential for our future.

WHO WE ARE
We are transformation catalysts, applying the wisdom of feminine intelligence, for the shift in consciousness needed to achieve equitable, just, inclusive societies, and communities, respecting all sentient beings and Mother Earth.

Transformation catalysts are the Entrepreneurs, Pathfinders, Warriors, and Lovers in action bringing about systemic change. They are sourced from the deep knowing that an elevation in human consciousness is needed. It is the Healers, Creatives, Indigenous communities who are foundational in bringing systemic change.

These catalysts have moved beyond the old beliefs that keep a dysfunctional system in place, they are actively creating and telling a new story, bringing about a deep cultural revolution."

## Theory of change

"To bring about the transformation needed we will need to acknowledge the mindset, beliefs and patterns of behaviour that have brought about our demise; whot we have adopted and how we have adapted. Then to create a shift in consciousness and bring about a deep respect for what have traditionally been seen as feminine qualities, this is not simply a shift in roles or positions of power.

We must restore a balance between intellect and intuition, facts and feelings, reason and realism. A recognition of our untapped human qualities and potential that lies at the core of our being, must be activated and embodied in the way we live and lead." https://femmeq.org/what-is-femmeq/
