## Body

In our earliest history, just over a centenary ago, a group of medical professionals who called themselves the Tavistock group worked with the British Army to help soldiers who had been prisoners during World War II return to civilian life and – equally as importantly – to help their families and communities adjust to having them back.

From returning soldiers to rapid changes in business management, workplace demographics, and the adoption (or rejection) of new technologies throughout the 20th century … to the global, social challenges of the 21st century, we pour ourselves into organisations needing change, individuals needing change, systems needing change.

(And sometimes the change needed, is to accept change isn’t needed.)

What arises from the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations isn’t abstract, it’s applicable study making a difference in all of our lives.
