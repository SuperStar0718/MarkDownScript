## Body

Many more diverse people and organizations need to collaborate. And many more will be willing to, if they believe their efforts and the results they are producing, are fair â€” that justice is not being sacrificed for speed and scale.

Radical collaboration is a pragmatic and proven approach to working together across differences to move forward with speed, scale, and justice.

It is radical in the sense that it is unusual and gets to the root of the challenge of collaborating. It can be used to address many complex challenges and must be used to address the climate crisis.
