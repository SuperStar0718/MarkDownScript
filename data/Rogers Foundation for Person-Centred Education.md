### description: 
  "Based on Carl R. Rogers’s thoughts, we believe that a person can understand and fulfil him or herself through live, personal experiences and in relationships of positive regard and real acceptance.

Our mission is to make people conscious about the importance of acceptance by experiencing it, and to provide places for real encounters, overcoming all obstacles.

For this purpose, we organize and run educational, experiential activities, and research and development services."
