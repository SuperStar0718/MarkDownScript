## Body

"Re-Alliance promotes a regenerative vision for the humanitarian and development sectors.

We are a coalition of regenerative practitioners, educators, humanitarian and aid workers, and policy makers. From Permaculture in refugee settlements, to eco-building in disaster prone regions, to water harvesting in areas severely affected by worsening climate change, our members showcase how we can create stability, resilience and abundance, even in times of crisis."
