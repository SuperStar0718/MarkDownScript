### description: 
  "The Global Center for Indigenous Leadership and Lifeways (GCILL) is an informal umbrella created to support long-term and short-term projects that educate and inform people about Indigenous ways to raise human consciousness and  co-create a harmonious relationship with Mother Earth.


The initial focus of GCILL is to advance the capacity to share the messages of wisdom keepers, including the work of  Ilarion 'Kuuyux' Merculieff while helping other-selves and Mother Earth."
