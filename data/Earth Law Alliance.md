### description: 
  "The term ‘Earth law’ describes inherently ecocentric laws that have been emerging around the world over the last few decades. Broadly speaking, the aim of Earth Law is to protect and/or regenerate various forms of life on Earth. Either as a specific aim or as a secondary outcome, Earth Law seeks to maintain the biogeochemical cycles on which life on Earth depends.[...]

Earth Law (sometimes also referred to as Wild Law, Earth Laws or Ecological Law) encompasses a wide range of initiatives and developments, such as the inclusion of Earth Rights or Rights of Nature in national constitutions, the Earth Charter initiative, the proposed international law of Ecocide and Crimes Against Future Generations, the establishment of an International Court for the Environment, local community initiatives to protect ecosystems and research into whole systems approaches to justice and governance.
