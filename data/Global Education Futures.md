## Body

"Global Education Futures is a path breaking and paradigm forming initiative that takes on the challenge of exploring, experimenting, emerging, and engaging systemic innovation for lifelong and lifewide learning.

By fostering the emergence of living learning communities, and bringing these communities into connection with each other to form socio-technical learning ecosystems, we are paving the way for a new brand of human to emerge.

What We Do: The way we work is by cooperating with our partners to co-create projects that have positive impact in education and on society as a whole. We create visions for education and share and apply these visions collaboratively.

Our focal areas of interest include skills of the future, learning ecosystems, empowering learners of all ages and creating prototypes for educational change."
