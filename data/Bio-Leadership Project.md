### description: 
  “Leadership defined by growth, winner-takes-all competition, consumption and separation is a root of many of the problems we see in the world.
But a new story of leadership is growing, working with the rules of life: cycles, connection, regeneration, reciprocity and love.
Our vision is to help a global ecosystem of people to grow this new story all over the world.

Five kinds of Bio-Leadership story are redefining human progress. Our work is about helping these stories connect up and grow.

-New forms of purpose and progress connected to nature.
-New organisational forms that work like nature.
-New ways of working as ecosystems, inspired by nature.
-New, regenerative models of organisation and society.
-New cultures that reconnect to nature and the web of life.

To grow new forms of leadership, we need to grow new forms of knowledge. 
To navigate complex and urgent times, we need to cultivate human capacities for resilience, connection, adaptability, systemic awareness, and care for things greater than ourselves. 
Bio-Leadership is about working with nature to grow these qualities as individuals, communities, businesses and society.
We do this by working with nature to support three forms of knowledge:

-Nature-Based Thinking: This is about understanding and working with practical and organisational ideas inspired by nature, such as circular models, regenerative models and new organisational and economic models.

- Nature-Based Being:  This is about working with qualities that grow when we take the time to stop, notice and work with nature’s patterns. It is about developing resilience, awareness, connection, and an understanding of how life flows.

- Collective Movement: This is knowledge that is needed to help us learn as whole systems and connected communities. It is knowledge related to organisational learning, cultural change and deep personal and social transformation.”
