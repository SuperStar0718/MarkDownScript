### Notes/comments/questions: 
  4 - intentional community / ecovillage focusing on personal / spiritual development experimenting with different ways of living; seems quite grounded and pragmatic; not much emphasis on connecting their work with problems in the wider world

### description: 
  The Community of Living Ethics is a cultural, aconfessional and apolitical non-profit association founded in 1981 by Sergio Bartoli and a group of 11 friends, all psychosynthesisers. The intent was the creation of a Psychosynthesis Community in the farmhouse of Poggio del Fuoco, which soon began hosting courses related to psychosynthetic personal development and creative meditation. The community is based on study, meditation, service and group life.

The Community contains, even if in miniature, all aspects of human life. Over the years, activities have arisen in all fields, both daily (cooking, administration, care of land, gardens and farmhouses...) and aimed at developing consciousness (art, science, education, culture). It therefore tends to integrate the great visions proposed by the teachings, with daily human life [...].

With time and thanks to the contribution of many, seven farmhouses and two villages have been developed, spread over an area of 25 km.
