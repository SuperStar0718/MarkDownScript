##Body

"The Collective Leadership Institute is a cutting-edge organization with deep expertise in bringing emerging paradigm leadership concepts to multi-stakeholder processes and projects in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. [...]

OUR VISION

Our vision is to empower future-oriented people to lead collectively towards a sustainable future.

Sustainability is a truly global issue. How well we meet that challenge, success and failure in moving towards a more sustainable way of living, affects everybody. We believe in the principle of cooperation and collectively created solutions – across sectors, institutions, nations, and cultures.

OUR MISSION

With our Collective Leadership Academy, our Transformation Stewardship, our Collective Leadership Hubs Network, and our Research and Thought Leadership, we build competence for sustainability. We empower leaders who anchor their action in the concern for the greater good and the future of humankind on this planet – for responsible business, people-oriented public service, and a strong civil society.

We build a global community for change by activating networks and fostering mutual support among change agents.

We empower people globally to use our methodology of dialogic change and collective leadership for sustainability."
