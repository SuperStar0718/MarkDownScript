### description: 
  "In order to create meaningful impact, businesses, organisations and groups of all sizes must be able to navigate historically unprecedented levels of complexity and uncertainty. Collective Transitions offers a grounded set of transformational approaches and practices for groups and facilitators to better navigate these shifts. We are an action-learning and research hub working with a wide range of clients, especially social change and multi-stakeholder initiatives."

"Vision
Collective Transitions understands that the future does not lie ahead of us, but exists right here in our current ways of being. The patterns that are present now determine how the future will be. We envision a society that deeply respects and serves all forms of life, and we are building and refining a set of shared practices to facilitate a collective shift in this direction. 

By expanding our perception, senses, and presence, we can become more adept at navigating the complexities and uncertainties of our time. Even in a situation that may feel like a crisis, we can move gently, with maturity, perseverance, and grace. 

Mission
Our mission is to activate the dormant capacities that are required for navigating complexity. We provide awareness-based tools that amplify collective knowledge,  and practice spaces where people can deepen and align their ways of working together."
