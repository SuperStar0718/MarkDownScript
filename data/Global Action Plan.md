### Notes/comments/questions: 
  5. Paraphrase Zak Stein to talk of "a time between education worlds" in one of their initiatives. More about behavioural change and systems change than inner change at the level of consciousness. Talk about transformative learning as a disorienting and uncomfortable process in which beliefs and values are challenged --> paradigmatic transformation, although the site seems to have mainstream appeal in its language. More general point: in assessing centre relevance how do we discern between using the right words but not having the actions/practice to back that up, vs. very aligned activities, using language with more mainstream appeal (which might be a strategic communication decision)

### description: 
  "Global Action Plan is an environmental charity focused on issues where the connection between the health of people and our planet is most tangible.

Global Action Plan mobilises people and organisations to take action on the systems that harm us and our planet. Through our work we create the political and policy conditions for more radical action, connecting behaviour change to systems change. 

Our cycle of change involves three connected steps that influence systems change through mobilisation:

- Research - We identify why and how the system needs to change.
- Collective action - We inspire and support people and organisations with the knowledge, resources, networks and agency to take action around this common goal.
- Campaigns - We influence decision makers to change the systems that harm people and the environment."
