### description: 
  Partners for a New Economy is an international philanthropic fund focused on transforming our economy for nature and all people to flourish. We were founded in 2015 by the MAVA, Oak, Marisla and KR Foundations, to address the root causes of environmental degradation that lie within our economic system. In 2020 we were joined by Laudes and Ford Foundations, by Omidyar Network in 2022 and by the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation in 2023.

The initiatives we fund show a deep understanding of planetary boundaries and an urgency to transform our economy to live within them. They push the frontiers of alternative economic thinking, and work to change the rules, goals and mindsets underpinning our current economic system.

We work collaboratively. Our grant-making and field-building are delivered in close partnership with our funders. We have a small team of staff based in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland and operate as a philanthropic fund hosted by Swiss Philanthropy Foundation. Our Board is made up of representatives from each of our Funding Partners, who work closely with the executive team.
