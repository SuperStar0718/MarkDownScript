### description: 
  "A Pan-European movement uniting civil society and funders in the transition to healthy, just & sustainable food environments. [...]

We bring together stakeholders from different sectors (health, food, climate change, biodiversity, animal welfare, labour rights and just transitions) with a shared belief that the current food system is unsustainable, unhealthy, and unjust.

Started to ponder over the initiative’s concept in 2020, it was in 2021 that over 120 civil society groups and funders co-created a strategic framework, imagining a food future where all people are able to eat healthy, just and sustainable diets with a lot of plant-based and little and nature-friendly animal-based foods.

In this future, foods are produced in ways that regenerate ecosystems, protect animal rights, and support workers.

Overall our first and foremost priority  is to decrease the consumption of harmful animal-sourced foods and to promote sustainable plant- and pasture-based foods in Europe through changing food environments.

HFHP aims to be a movement of movements by lifting up and building bridges between campaigns and networks within and between European countries, connecting and catalysing civil society to break down silos, and driving systemic change."
