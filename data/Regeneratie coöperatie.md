### description: 
  "The Regeneration Cooperative is a collective of entrepreneurs and scientists, coaches and artists who actively work for a regenerative society in which all people see and behave as part of nature. Because we believe that by removing the imaginary boundary between man and nature, all life on this earth can flourish again.

To achieve this, we want to develop, inspire and grow and flourish regenerative leaders, organizations and communities. We do this by building the regenerative movement through events, action days, workshops and lectures, providing personal coaching programs and training to organizations."

  A regenerative society: "In a regenerative society, we experience and behave as part of the ecosystems we depend on. We care for the more-than-human world on a personal, collective and societal level by basing our choices on what adds value to us and the systems we are part of. Regeneration is a way of life, based on the balance between giving and taking, taking responsibility for yourself and your choices and equality between people and between people and the rest of nature."
