## Body

"The objective of the Foundation is to help people and organisations in a world of rapidly increasing complexity through strategic and transformative innovation, with the aim to promote environmental protection and the well being of mankind in the broad sense by achieving socio-economic impact in the field of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

A MULTISIDED PLATFORM MODEL FOR SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION

Creating an open and dynamic multi-sided platform, a Space called CHÔRA. At its core, this space has a Strategic Design capability that seeds and structures Portfolios of Innovation Options. In these portfolios learning activities and sensemaking protocols generate intelligence that feeds into strategic arguments. These arguments support innovation and transformational intents and the design of execution pathways."
