### description: 
  "PurposeFlow Living, is an initiative committed to ecological restoration and raising social-environmental awareness. Our project site, a 6-hectare plot located in one of the driest areas of Europe, in the arid region of Pavia, Portugal, was started by one person and has since grown to work through time with more than 250 volunteers from nearly 70 countries! We bring the focus on implementing innovative but also ancient regenerative practices to serve the earth in a holistic manner."
