## Body

"Our commitment is to inspire will and build capacity to collectively accelerate regenerative food systems as a means to restore human and planetary health. [...] 

The origin of every program is centered on listening to farmers and our community. Each program is designed to uncover the creative potential between soil, human, community, and planetary health. This exploration happens in the caverns of our programming â€“ each designed to spur agency and create actionable change."
