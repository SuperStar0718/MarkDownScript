##Body

"We are designers, developers, social systems architects, economists, storytellers, and movement builders innovating social, technological, and financial tools that support our ability to collectively innovate on, resource, and apply solutions to the world’s most pressing issues. 

Although Open Future Coalition is the culmination of our team and partners’ life’s work, we came together officially in January of 2021 to help the global impact ecosystem strengthen its collaborative capacity by empowering the transparent exchange of capital, skills, and knowledge in service of measurable impact.  [...]

We are honored to be growing alongside a rich impact ecosystem who are stewarding innovative and essential projects in areas like Regenerative Agriculture, Food Systems, Water, Community Wellness, Community Resilience, Climate Action, and Economic Equity. From community-led watershed remediation in Rajasthan to food systems collaboration and education in Hawai’i, healthy childcare in Chicago to food forests in Zimbabwe, we truly believe that this rich soil of collective learning will allow a vibrant and complex understory to take root. [...]

By continuing to gather, apply, and advance collective community intelligence through distributed technology, capital innovation, social architecture, educational and community programming, and participatory design, we believe that together, we can write a new story for humanity that values our community and planetary thriving above speculation and extraction."
