### description: 
  "WE NEED NEW THINKING AND NEW ACTION
Governing the Anthropocene is the ultimate challenge of the 21st century. We are concerned with the ecological meltdown as well as with the digital transformation. We build on Anthropocene Thinking and explore Metamodernity. Systems Change lies at the very heart of the European School of Governance as a true thought and practice leader a European New School realising the necessary Mind Shift in the tradition of the legendary Bauhaus. Being a community of inquiry and transformation, we research and teach. We engage and intervene. We believe in dialogue, provoking and facilitating public discourse. [...]

The EUSG is a school of thought, reflection, and practice. This aspiration is what makes the difference. Prior to teaching and experiential learning, we explore, research, and design the conditions for the possibility to change and govern a thrivable world.

The EUSG is a school of governance in the broadest sense of governing the Anthropocene. Naturally this includes looking at politics and business, at organisation and change, dealing with management, leadership and entrepreneurship. However, it spreads out far broader to all walks of life, experiences and insights, and it reaches far deeper into the epistemological foundations and of our society."
