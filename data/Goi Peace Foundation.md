##Body

"Based in Japan, the Goi Peace Foundation is a public benefit organization supported by members around the world working together to create a culture of peace. Our mission is to foster a sustainable and harmonious global society by promoting consciousness, values and wisdom for creating peace, and building cooperation among individuals and organizations across diverse fields, including education, science, culture and the arts.

To achieve this mission, we engage mainly in the following activities:
- Public events including conferences, symposia and lectures to inform and inspire the public to expand their visions, and to engage their participation in contributing to a better world.
- Educational programs for young people designed to nurture inner peace, respect for life and global awareness, emphasizing the leading role they can play in fostering world peace and sustainable development.
- International collaboration with organizations and partners worldwide to promote global dialogue and outreach for advancing the cause of peace.
- Interdisciplinary research and studies to advance new worldviews, perspectives and practices that will support personal and social transformation toward a new civilization.

The Goi Peace Foundation embodies the spirit of Masahisa Goi (1916-1980), a Japanese spiritual teacher, philosopher, poet and author who dedicated his life to peace and humanity"
