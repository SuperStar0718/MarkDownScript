## Body

"Home for Humanity is an inclusive movement for planetary regeneration.

We activate the power of our homes to pioneer regenerative futures.

Together, we strive to transform our divided world into a united, inclusive, regenerative, just and peaceful home for humanity and the diversity of life on Earth. [...]

We catalyse the power of Home:
... of the INNER HOME of our humanity, to fulfil our unique purpose and potential as agents of transformation. 

... of the LOCAL HOMES we live and work in, to make them integral pioneers of personal, local and societal regeneration.

... to serve the one EARTH HOME we share, drawing on the wisdom and innovations of every geography, culture and country to shape together an inclusive and regenerative future for the indivisible family of life on Earth.

â€‹This is the transformative work of the Home for Humanity Movement for Planetary Regeneration, active locally and globally, on all continents."
