### description: 
  "Be The Earth is a UK based foundation that combines impact investing and philanthropy for a world that nurtures all beings. Committed to living in harmony with Earth, BTE entrusts all of its capital to people, programmes and places that are creating resilient solutions for our regenerative future, with a particular focus on food systems. 

Based on the belief that a paradigm shift is needed, Be The Earth supports initiatives that are promoting a mindset of collaboration and abundance, and refuting the exploitation that is driving ecological collapse.

Working with a system of trust-based relationships that moves away from colonialist and bureaucratic models, Be The Earth focuses on strengthening relationships of co-responsibility and interdependence. Using a circular financing model, all profits are reinvested or allocated to philanthropic partnerships and to leveraging the vital non-financial resources found within our network of key collaborators: farmers, activists, women, entrepreneurs, indigenous people and funders."
