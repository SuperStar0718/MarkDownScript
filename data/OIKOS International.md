## key People



## Theory of change

They see themselves as working for change on multiple levels: "individual development", "institutional development", "international development" and "planetary sustainable development" 
https://oikos-international.org/who-we-are/ 

Their own team structure is "inspired by theories of self-organizing such as Holacracy, Sociocracy and Reinventing Organizations"
