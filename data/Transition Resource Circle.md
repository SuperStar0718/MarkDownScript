### Notes/comments/questions: 
  2. First conceptualised through The Rules (precursor to Culture Hack Labs). They see the metacrisis as something within us, not just outside of us and this is central to their outlok, approach, and activities. Inner work of spiritual/political praxis is a key ingredient.

### description: 
  "We have called this project the Transition Resource Circle because we are focused on the broader transition from our current meta-crisis to adjacent possible futures. We work with resources and resource holders to alchemize and liberate capital to be in service to Life. We work through circle ways (e.g. non-hierarchical, embodied cognition approaches, psycho-spiritual practices) to move from a culture of entitlement to ways which honor the multiple entanglements of historical precedents, our respective lineages & karmic storylines, and what future beings (including ourselves) require for reconciliation and healing."
