## Body

"We have called this project the Transition Resource Circle because we are focused on the broader transition from our current meta-crisis to adjacent possible futures. We work with resources and resource holders to alchemize and liberate capital to be in service to Life. We work through circle ways (e.g. non-hierarchical, embodied cognition approaches, psycho-spiritual practices) to move from a culture of entitlement to ways which honor the multiple entanglements of historical precedents, our respective lineages & karmic storylines, and what future beings (including ourselves) require for reconciliation and healing."
