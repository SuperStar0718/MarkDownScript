### description: 
  "AR+ supports a global community, online and face to face, so that  action-oriented scholar practitioners find community and developmental support in responding to the call of our times. 

We believe that our global social-ecological challenges (crises) demand a new context for scholarships of all kinds. In supporting ART Action-oriented Research for Transformation AR+ offers specific resources such as coaching, co-labs, curriculum, workshops, so that fellow (feral?) scholar-practitioners may find what's next for them in their self- and community developmental evolution. 

AR+ is unusual for our emphasis on practice. For example, all our co-lab efforts are designed to encourage new experiments for re-weaving activist, artistic and scientific dimensions of knowledge creation. The value of participating in this loosely knit global community is that we learn, cross-pollinate and amplify innovative efforts."
