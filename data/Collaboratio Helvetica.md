### Notes/comments/questions: 
  In terms of sector, this is more consultancy / coaching / training. Some buzzwords used (co-creation, transformative learning, systems thinking...), with an emphasis on mindset and attitudes. Doesn't seem close to the centre of the 2R ecosystem though, and doesn't really fit anywhere on the map (I put it in the generic category of 'Regenerative Alternatives' - 7

### description: 
  "The challenges of our time require new forms of collaboration and a holistic way of thinking. Switzerland has a long tradition of collaboration and dialogue across language barriers and religious divides. Collaboratio helvetica therefore believes in Switzerland's unique potential to leverage participatory approaches and collaboration to contribute to a change towards more ecological responsibility, humanity and the common good. 

The organisation catalyses the societal transformation of Switzerland by cultivating a cross-sectoral innovation ecosystem, building capacity for systemic change and convening stakeholders around the complex challenges addressed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Collaboratio helvetica empowers committed people and organisations to shift deeply ingrained attitudes and mindsets,  conduct dialogues more effectively, implement new forms of collaboration and thus collectively imagine and shape the Switzerland of tomorrow."

### theory of change: 
  "The impact of human activity on the planet's ecosystem is apparent, and many ways are being sought to find solutions to remedy the climate crisis. Yet, attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 seems more and more unrealistic, and no overarching solutions seem to be taking form.

WHAT IF WE COULD IDENTIFY LEVERAGE POINTS – SMALL ACTIONS WITH THE POWER TO TRANSFORM ENTIRE SYSTEMS?
With the Catalyst Lab, we do exactly that: We empower dedicated changemakers (Catalysts) and their teams to have a deeper systemic impact with their work by addressing the root causes of today’s challenges."
