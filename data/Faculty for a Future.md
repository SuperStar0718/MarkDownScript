## Body

"Faculty for a Future exists to coalesce the energy for change in academia, share insights from a fast-growing community of academics transforming their own work now, and build momentum for a systemic reorienting of academia’s role, inside or – if necessary – outside of existing structures. As a movement, we want to unite in the pursuit of a shared vision for all life to thrive equally on a finite and unprecedentedly unstable planet."
