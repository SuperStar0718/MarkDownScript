### description: 
  "Local Futures is an international non-profit organization dedicated to renewing ecological and social well-being by strengthening communities and local economies. Together we’re building a worldwide localization movement.

The Local Futures team works from four continents, with main offices in the USA, Australia and the UK.

Founder and director Helena Norberg-Hodge is a widely-respected analyst of the global economy’s impacts on communities, local economies, and personal identity around the world.

What we do
- Share the big picture: We illuminate and explore the systemic root causes of our current global crises with our books, films, campaigns, ‘education for action’ tools, and worldwide activist-oriented events.
- Unite and connect: We focus on root causes, not symptoms, to create common ground among activists, small farmers, indigenous communities, main street business owners—and everyone else.
- Show a path forward: We promote economic localization—shifting our economies towards place-based, human-scale activity—as a strategy for change that simultaneously addresses our many crises."

### theory of change: 
  
### : 
  "We envision a localized future where most of our food comes from nearby farmers who are a part of our community and who ensure food security year round. Where money we spend on everyday goods continues to recirculate in the local economy, building community prosperity along the way. Where multinational businesses and banks adhere to the rules of society – not the other way around. Where local businesses are thriving and multiplying, thereby providing ample, meaningful livelihoods for everyone."
