### description: 
  "The Citizens’ Initiative for an Integral Green Slovenia, founded in April 2013 by a group of distinguished Slovenian experts and led by Dr. Darja Piciga, is a pan-Slovenian and non-partisan initiative for a wholesome life in the internationally respected community of Slovenia. [...]

The Initiative for an Integral Green Slovenia is based on the conviction that by building on the country’s potentials for all four integral economic paths (i.e., self-sufficient community-based economy, developmental culture-based economy, social knowledge based economy and “living” life-based economy) and fundamental values underlying its cultural heritage, we have the opportunity, in both theory and practice, to co-evolve a knowledge-and-value based economy and sustainable society that can serve as a pilot case for the integral green approach at a time when Europe is seeking to develop a smart (knowledge-based), sustainable and inclusive society and economy."
