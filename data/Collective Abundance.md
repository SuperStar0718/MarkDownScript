### Notes/comments/questions: 
  Core values (Solidarity, embrace complexity, openness, courage, joy) suggest inner-led/integrative approach. See climate crisis as a social/systemic issue not just a scientific/ecological issue. Small and new org. 6 for closeness to centre.

### description: 
  "Collective Abundance is a new collaborative initiative, working to change the way philanthropy redistributes wealth to climate justice organisers in Europe and building collective organised power amongst those working on the frontlines of the climate crisis.

WHAT WE DO: Shifting European philanthropy from a climate change to a climate justice agenda.
We want to support a just and reparative redistribution of philanthropic wealth in order to help build collective power amongst those working to address the root causes of the climate crisis, and their related impacts."
