##Body

"The CHE (Center for Human Emergence) is based on the realization that unity is self-evident and that the current complexity calls for an entirely new paradigm, which transcends and includes everything we know so far. That is why the CHE is investigating how Integral leadership can contribute to social innovation and can provide a solid basis for the realization of everyone's personal mission. We wholeheartedly invite you to participate and use your talent."
