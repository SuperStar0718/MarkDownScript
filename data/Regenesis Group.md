### description: 
  "Regenesis is a world leader in the field of regenerative development—an approach to land use, community development, and the built environment that has defined the leading edge of sustainability practice for more than two decades.

Those looking to advance the field of sustainability have taken up a powerful challenge. Aiming beyond the goal to do less harm, these pioneers are committed to proving that human activity can be a source of health and regeneration, rather than destruction and degradation. Living up to this promise will require humans to step up and develop a firm grasp of the complex working of natural systems in order to harmonize and evolve with nature.

Regenesis supports this work through client services—providing the foundational thinking and management support needed to engage in regenerative projects and community development initiatives worldwide—as well as through education programs for practitioners of architecture, planning and community development."
