### description: 
  "A resource of film-based courses and tools grounded in mindfulness, lucid dreaming, shadow integration, compassion, mindful activism, sustainability and all things that help wake up the mind.

Our aim is to inspire mindful change and to help the world wake up collectively.

We believe that global change can only begin through a change in our own minds. We hope to present a resource that can help support inner change. To change your mind is to change the world.

We welcome the shift from the old paradigm of competition to a new one of cooperation, therefore we invite other organizations, individuals and communities to join us on the Awake Academy journey!"
