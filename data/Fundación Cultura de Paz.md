##Body

In 2000, the Culture of Peace Foundation was established with the aim of strengthening and promoting the culture of peace, implementing and putting into action the Declaration and Program of Action, approved in 1999 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.

"The culture of peace is a set of values, attitudes and behaviors that reflect respect for life, human beings and their dignity. It places human rights, the rejection of violence in all its forms and adherence to the principles of freedom, justice, solidarity and tolerance, as well as understanding between peoples, groups and individuals at the forefront."

Its activity is mainly based on the support and development of initiatives and educational, dissemination, reflection and action activities in the field that contribute to the construction and consolidation of a culture of peace through the implementation of the Declaration on the Culture of Peace, related to the eight actions of the Action Program: education for peace; sustainable economic and social development; human rights; equality and gender; democratic participation; dialogue, understanding and tolerance among peoples, races and religions; freedom of information, communication and expression; international peace and security.
