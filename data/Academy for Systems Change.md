## Body

"The Academy for Systems Change is a nonprofit organization focused on advancing the field of awareness-based systemic change in order to accelerate ecological, social, and economic well-being."

## key People



## Theory of change

How they understand systems change: "Systems change is inherently an “inner” and “outer” process or journey. This work involves deep shifts in paradigms, mental models, relational practices, and taken-for-granted ways of operating, as much as it involves shifts in organizational structures, metrics, goals, policies, and procedures. Because of this, we believe that the development of self is foundational. This inner work – which involves developing awareness, compassion, and analysis – also extends to teams, networks, organizations, and ultimately to the larger systems within which we work."
