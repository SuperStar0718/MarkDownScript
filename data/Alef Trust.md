"The Alef Trust - https://www.aleftrust.org/ - is a global leader in transformative education and training in the areas consciousness, transpersonal and spiritual psychology.  Our validated/accredited online postgraduate programmes https://www.aleftrust.org/academic-learning/ include Master’s (MSc), Certificates, Diploma,  and PhD as well as Open Learning routes https://www.aleftrust.org/personal-development/ for those who want to study for personal enrichment. We facilitate many of our educational programmes online, providing 1-to-1 virtual tuition and guidance. 

Students from across all our programmes have the opportunity to participate in a dynamic international learning community, in which mind, body and spirit are equally honoured.

The MSc operates through our partnership with Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), UK. The programme is validated/accredited by LJMU, meaning that the university ensures the quality of the MSc.

 The MSc is further enhanced by a partnership of the Alef Trust with the Scientific and Medical Network (SMN), UK, a worldwide professional community for open-minded, rigorous and evidence-based enquiry into themes bridging science, spirituality and consciousness. Students become members of the network for the duration of their studies and have access to the network’s newsletter and its unique audio-visual lecture archive featuring many inspiring presentations by new paradigm scientists and scholars.
