In 2010, we set out to find land in Serra da Estrela to build and establish an Ananda Marga Master Unit in Portugal. The dream was to create a model integrated development project and blissful community for collective spiritual practice, self-realization and service to all beings. That dream is what we now call Ananda Kalyani. Our community has grown over the past 12 years from a small group of visionaries and an overgrown and desolate land into a recognized Master Unit, GEN European ecovillage and ERASMUS+ Partner.

WHO
We are artists who meditate and meditators who make art. We aim to live close to the Earth in order to unlearn the oppressive systems of the overculture and cultivate a viable alternative for future generations. 

OUR STORY
The Art Monastery began in 2007 in a series of historic monasteries across Italy as a secular non-profit arts organization. Ever since, we have hosted visiting artists, offered cultural events for the public, and applied the monastic principles of discipline, contemplation, and sustainability to our creative process. In 2016 we moved our operations to a seven-acre farm in Vermont (pictured above). After seven years in Italy, seven years in Vermont, three years in Hawai’i (video below), we are now located in San Francisco. We offer online programs and in-person retreats in various locations, including Green Gulch Farm, Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, and the Berkeley Alembic. [...]

OUR MISSION
The Art Monastery is a radical experiment that bridges creative and contemplative practices. Through avant garde monasticism, we take up new and old ways of artmaking to create a social ecology defined by heart-centered, body-positive, justice-seeking values.  In this way, we balance the art element of our mission (intuition, activism, and re-wilding) with the monastery element (structure and schedule, personal growth, and ancient traditions). We support each other in our own journeys of artmaking, spiritual practice and reciprocity with the earth.""

But a new story of leadership is growing, working with the rules of life: cycles, connection, regeneration, reciprocity and love.
Our vision is to help a global ecosystem of people to grow this new story all over the world.

Five kinds of Bio-Leadership story are redefining human progress. Our work is about helping these stories connect up and grow.

-New forms of purpose and progress connected to nature.
-New organisational forms that work like nature.
-New ways of working as ecosystems, inspired by nature.
-New, regenerative models of organisation and society.
-New cultures that reconnect to nature and the web of life.

To grow new forms of leadership, we need to grow new forms of knowledge. 
To navigate complex and urgent times, we need to cultivate human capacities for resilience, connection, adaptability, systemic awareness, and care for things greater than ourselves. 
Bio-Leadership is about working with nature to grow these qualities as individuals, communities, businesses and society.
We do this by working with nature to support three forms of knowledge:

-Nature-Based Thinking: This is about understanding and working with practical and organisational ideas inspired by nature, such as circular models, regenerative models and new organisational and economic models.

- Nature-Based Being:  This is about working with qualities that grow when we take the time to stop, notice and work with nature’s patterns. It is about developing resilience, awareness, connection, and an understanding of how life flows.

- Collective Movement: This is knowledge that is needed to help us learn as whole systems and connected communities. It is knowledge related to organisational learning, cultural change and deep personal and social transformation.”

We develop into the direction those involved put energy in. Participatory culture, events, art and design, urban placemaking and civic action-based initiatives are paths that have crystallised so far. Our intention is to remain open to future unknowns and establish a place in Stockholm that supports nascent ideas by sharing risks and providing the budding crews with an ecosystem of kind and talented professionals to realise their dreams. We want to create a playground for ideas and dialogue countering polarisation and invite national and international actors to establish collaborative relationships devoid of a competition mindset.

Our space is an independent contributor to culture, policy innovation and urban development in Stockholm. We concentrate the effort towards our immediate surroundings, working from the inside-out while staying updated through national and international partners and networks and connected with contemporary social challenges. Through enabling rapid use of our physical spaces, we have so far supported two large civic actions focused on leveraging effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and providing a community centre for Ukrainian refugees.  Blivande wants to give more and proof that a creative cluster can be a responsible and self-sustaining civil society institution. Our community network has a multitude of different resources and types of capital that can be leveraged towards current societal needs. We are creating an environment that inspires to action.

Humanity has and will continue to be facing intimidating challenges in the coming centuries. We need spaces that combine the possibility to talk maturely about our collective grief and confusion while providing avenues to channel that energy into action. Bottom-up initiatives like Blivande can complement top-down systems through providing a nest for social innovation, systemic experimentation and active hope. We believe we are not in need of a single utopian future but a multitude of realistic futures to accommodate the diverse populations of our city. This requires a great deal of imagination, openness and bravery. No organisation, individual or business can do it alone. As a collective, we support each other to dare to manifest our ideas into reality thus prototyping our version of an interdependent and responsible future.

In the spirit of participation and do-ocracy, we are currently implementing a renewed legal organisational form. We are working on an “Exit to Community”, transforming the not-for-profit company into a legal structure supporting communal ownership. Those that invest most time in developing the platform should be able to steward it. Being a steward of Blivande grants benefits, but also comes with responsibilities and sharing certain risks. However, you don’t have to be steward to influence the space. Collaborative decision making, co-budgeting and financial transparency permeate the project through various levels of involvement such as grant allocating for infrastructure developments, decision making about tool purchases for the atelier or curation of the art and culture program at Frihamnstorget.

In the centre of all the chaos and beauty, there are our people. Without that heart, we would only be a beautiful corpse. There wouldn’t be anything without all the individuals that decide to spend their time and work at Blivande. The house is inhabited by a genuine and caring crowd that constantly pushes for inclusion of the different and embraces the challenge of what that entails. This third space - neither fully private nor fully public - is becoming a home to its members and a source of meaning and solidarity for many. We like to juggle the complicated world between the professional and the personal with the aim to unravel a beneficial development of relationships, collaborations and organisations within our ecosystem. We believe that interdependence is a good complement to societies hyper-individualism and are curious to explore its implication.

It is our outermost priority to stay an institution with heart and minimal bureaucracy. Over the past years, Blivande has gained a higher degree of expert professionalism having started from a small group of friends with the habit of reinventing the wheel on each occasion. Now we are at the point where our core activities are financially viable and independent. As the community reaches maturity and the organisation antifragility, we aspire to unlock the capacity for the larger core team to prioritise outreach, cross-sectorial collaborations and to be more overtly political. In what form, is yet to be seen. We hope to be contributors of fundamental rather than decorative societal change. Ideally, without stopping to be a place for weird motherfuckers.”

OUR VISION

Our vision is to empower future-oriented people to lead collectively towards a sustainable future.

Sustainability is a truly global issue. How well we meet that challenge, success and failure in moving towards a more sustainable way of living, affects everybody. We believe in the principle of cooperation and collectively created solutions – across sectors, institutions, nations, and cultures.

OUR MISSION

With our Collective Leadership Academy, our Transformation Stewardship, our Collective Leadership Hubs Network, and our Research and Thought Leadership, we build competence for sustainability. We empower leaders who anchor their action in the concern for the greater good and the future of humankind on this planet – for responsible business, people-oriented public service, and a strong civil society.

We build a global community for change by activating networks and fostering mutual support among change agents.

We empower people globally to use our methodology of dialogic change and collective leadership for sustainability.""

""People all over the world are gathering to regenerate the Earth at the bioregional scale and organize into a planetary network of learning exchanges between landscapes. All of this is being done in service to the regeneration of the entire Planet.

When Joe Brewer wrote his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, it was to show both the seriousness of the predicament we are in and to demonstrate that it really is possible to regenerate the Earth at the scales needed. The pathway he describes in the book is to organize ourselves around holistic, integrated landscapes known as bioregions, and connect those bioregions into a planetary network of learning exchanges.

Members of the Design School are working together on the ground in bioregions while simultaneously building a planetary network and community engaging in this kind of bioregional work. All of this enables focused actions to arise with clear design and intent so that we can effectively regenerate at the bioregional scale and create interactions and supports between and across bioregions.

The challenges humanity and the Earth are facing now are extremely complex and unlike anything that has come before in the history of the planet. In order to regenerate the Earth at the scales needed, we must consciously and intentionally evolve humanity into a ""planetary species"" and cooperate at unprecedented levels. Members of the Design School are choosing to step fully into this challenge and do what we can to embody and live out the design pathway for regenerating Earth.""

The EUSG is a school of thought, reflection, and practice. This aspiration is what makes the difference. Prior to teaching and experiential learning, we explore, research, and design the conditions for the possibility to change and govern a thrivable world.

The EUSG is a school of governance in the broadest sense of governing the Anthropocene. Naturally this includes looking at politics and business, at organisation and change, dealing with management, leadership and entrepreneurship. However, it spreads out far broader to all walks of life, experiences and insights, and it reaches far deeper into the epistemological foundations and of our society.""

To amplify the voices of women and empower those who are applying feminine intelligence to catalyse the transformation needed to create a flourishing future for all.

We are connecting to strengthen our resolve, collaborating to broaden our reach, celebrating the progress made, and deepening our commitment to play our role in bringing about a cultural revolution and systemic shift essential for our future.

WHO WE ARE
We are transformation catalysts, applying the wisdom of feminine intelligence, for the shift in consciousness needed to achieve equitable, just, inclusive societies, and communities, respecting all sentient beings and Mother Earth.

Transformation catalysts are the Entrepreneurs, Pathfinders, Warriors, and Lovers in action bringing about systemic change. They are sourced from the deep knowing that an elevation in human consciousness is needed. It is the Healers, Creatives, Indigenous communities who are foundational in bringing systemic change.

These catalysts have moved beyond the old beliefs that keep a dysfunctional system in place, they are actively creating and telling a new story, bringing about a deep cultural revolution.""

It is not a process as most humans have understood it to be in this present time. It's an embodied / immersive / experiential living system process where the process is not in the system but in the being of the person (also a living system / nature). [...]

For this collaboration to be deeply meaningful, we explore together how to move our hearts, minds and hands for collective action. This is supported by the practical realisation of our collaborations through experimentation and prototyping of independent and interdependent initiatives, based on timeless and modern knowledge, and time tested tools.

This culture allows for designing systems, processes and governance that is true and of integrity to living systems: co-creating conditions from all living forms to thrive and live as an organism rather than individual entities.

From this essence we can then experiment to act locally, connect and collaborate regionally and learn globally (through online and offline platforms), finding a multitude of unique and regional ways on how live in emergence and as a living organism.

LIVING MISSION
Through deep listening and nature-connection, we co-create a regenerative culture of care, learning and celebration that embodies interdependency and values meaningful connection.""

We bring together stakeholders from different sectors (health, food, climate change, biodiversity, animal welfare, labour rights and just transitions) with a shared belief that the current food system is unsustainable, unhealthy, and unjust.

Started to ponder over the initiative’s concept in 2020, it was in 2021 that over 120 civil society groups and funders co-created a strategic framework, imagining a food future where all people are able to eat healthy, just and sustainable diets with a lot of plant-based and little and nature-friendly animal-based foods.

In this future, foods are produced in ways that regenerate ecosystems, protect animal rights, and support workers.

Overall our first and foremost priority  is to decrease the consumption of harmful animal-sourced foods and to promote sustainable plant- and pasture-based foods in Europe through changing food environments.

With only 13% of people engaged at work, let's face it--how we manage and design organizations simply is not working. We've been treating organizations as if they are machines, pushing productivity and efficiency at the expense of long-term health. In this model, humans are resources that must be aligned on an org chart -- like cogs in a machine. But organizations are not machines.

The Academy serves as a forum for reflective scientists, artists, and scholars dedicated to addressing the pressing challenges confronting humanity today independent of political boundaries or limits, whether spiritual or physical — a forum where these problems can be discussed objectively, scientifically, globally, and free from vested interests or regional attachments to arrive at solutions that affirm universal human rights and serve the common good of all humanity. WAAS is founded on faith in the power of original and creative ideas — Real Ideas with effective power — to change the world.

​Our motto​: ​​​Leadership in thought that leads to action

WAAS Fellows come from diverse cultures, nationalities, intellectual disciplines and professions, chosen for eminence in the natural, technological and social sciences; the arts and humanities; different professions and fields of public service. The focus of WAAS from the beginning has been to address global social challenges.

The Pari Center for New Learning was founded in 2000 as a haven of peace and gentle action in a world increasingly gripped by turmoil—climate change, environmental disasters, injustice, inequality, destructive artificial intelligence, biosecurity, and more recently the pandemic and war in Europe. Above all the Pari Center is dedicated to the principle of ‘the spirit of place.’ Housed in a medieval village it is the ideal location to pause and think about the future and the values, meaning, and direction of contemporary society. In adopting Carlo Levi’s maxim that ‘the future has an ancient heart’ we look to the future while bearing in mind the wisdom of the past.

We promote an open and continuing dialogue on the role of science and technology, the marriage of science and the arts, ethics, community, the work of C.G. Jung, the importance of Indigenous knowledge, and the place of the sacred. We are dedicated to David Bohm’s vision of wholeness and encourage a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to learning. The Center also draws upon the idea of David Peat’s Gentle Action—a new form of intelligent, compassionate and mild action that flows from the entire field of meaning in which a particular individual, society or organization is a part.

We have no ‘mission statement’ as we are not on a mission. David Peat saw Pari as an ‘alchemical vessel’; a place where people could meet and express themselves freely within the safe atmosphere of this vessel; a place of transformation. When we get together, we throw everything into the alchemical pot and then wait to see what happens; what extraordinary things might emerge.""

""We’ve decided to start our vision right here where we live – El Valle; a municipality of three depopulating rural villages, between Granada and the coast. 

The La Bolina team moved to El Valle in December 2017 motivated by co-creating a project, and way of life, that balanced regeneration, integration and sustainability. 

We believe that through living locally and catalysing regenerative initiatives with others (in El Valle and further afield) we can together bring about sustained positive social and environmental change.

We are dedicated to the dignified and respectful integration of migrants and refugees , we run education and training programmes, we grow ecological veg to sell in veg boxes and to restaurants and eco shops bringing new circular economy to El Valle. 

Since arriving we have been joined by new project members, migrants and refugees, producers, students, collaborators and volunteers who have supported this young project to take root.

La Bolina is becoming integrated locally and regionally and our team members are becoming an active part of village life. This means that through connecting with local people we are actively listening to what is needed and learning from local traditions – whilst also bringing a global perspective on complexity, migration and the need for regenerative agriculture and localised food systems.

La Bolina’s projects and actions adapt (like a living ecosystem) responding to changes in the local context – such as connections with people, new collaborators, local politics, the trends in migration and the realities of the Spanish asylum system, availability of land and learning new farming techniques.""

Our “predicament” is societal collapse arising from our climate emergency, global economic and environmental crises, species extinction, soil degradation, extreme weather events, forced migration, historical and systemic planet and people abuse, and much more. 

On this website, we use the terms societal collapse or breakdown to describe the ending of our modern ways of sustaining human life. Different people within DAF view this as likely, inevitable or already happening. Societal collapse includes limited or nonexistent access to food, shelter, safety, pleasure, identity, and meaning, as well the failure of our institutions and social structures. 

The DA Forum emerged from Professor Jem Bendell’s academic paper, published in 2018 and revised in 2020. Both versions explore personal and collective changes to help people understand, prepare for, and live with societal disruption and collapse in as loving a way as possible. Bendell offers The Four Rs to help us define and live loving responses.

Everywhere, people are beginning to understand it is too late to avert a global environmental catastrophe. Many humans and nonhumans in more vulnerable parts of the world are already deeply affected. People are expressing fear and unease, sometimes in destructive ways. As the effects of climate chaos escalate, collective panic could bring about extreme forms of “othering,” such as xenophobia, racism, tribalism, cultural exclusion, and fascism.

No one knows exactly what will happen, where, or when. But DAF recognizes that biosphere and climate disruptions are forcing humans and other species to seek new ways and places to live. We are also keenly aware that although societal collapse is a global predicament, racialized and Indigenous communities, and almost all non-human species, suffer first and most. 

The DA Forum invites participants to understand collapse from a global and historical perspective, rather than something recently arising. DA Forum participants recognize that many communities have already experienced the trauma of collapse, whether from natural disasters or due to war, slavery, colonization, and/or other social injustices. 

These injustices, the associated traumas and their consequences are still being experienced by the global majority today. Injustice is the foundation of our privileged societies and economies. DAF recognizes the need for acknowledging injustices and the importance of reconciliation. 

The DA Forum stands in solidarity with all affected beings, human and more-than-human. We share learnings that may prevent injustices from continuing and promote response-ability awareness. 

The DAF community currently has about 15,000 participants from many backgrounds and countries. Adapting to all time zones, people connect with each other via live video or on blogs and social media. 

To promote global interweaving, DAF hosts many weekly and monthly events. DA Forum events address the complex challenges of being, knowing and doing as our environment and society collapse. 

Individual events welcome grief, relational work, compassionate listening, self-awareness, connection to Earth, spirituality and decolonization. There are also a variety of events inviting artistic expression as well as those exploring pragmatic areas such as education and permaculture.""

""Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures (GTDF) is an arts/research collective that uses this website as a workspace for collaborations around different kinds of artistic, pedagogical, cartographic, and relational experiments that aim to identify and de-activate colonial habits of being, and to gesture towards the possibility of decolonial futures.

GTDF is also a practice that is multi-layered and rather difficult to explain, but we will give it a go.

1. It is about hospicing worlds that are dying within and around us with care and integrity, as well as attention to the lessons these deaths offer, while also assisting with the birth of new, potentially wiser possibilities, without suffocating them with projections;
2. It is about facing our complicity in violence and unsustainability and its implications with the courage of really seeking to connect with the collective pain, past, present and future;
3. It is about composting our individual and collective shit with humility, joy, generosity and compassion, trying to “dig deeper and relate wider”;
4. It is about holding space for difficult conversations and silences without relationships falling apart;
5. It is about recognizing and taking responsibility for harmful modern-colonial habits of being (in ourselves and around us) that cannot be stopped by the intellect, by good intentions and by spiritual, artistic or embodied practices alone;
6. It is about interrupting modern-colonial addictions, in particular addictions to the consumption of knowledge, of self-actualization, of experiences, of critique, of alternatives, of relationships and of communities;
7. It is about recognizing that we are an extension of the land-metabolism that is the planet, not the other way around, preparing for the end of the world as we know it, and showing up differently so that “another end of the world” becomes possible;
8. It is about dis-investing in desires for unrestricted autonomy, authority, certainty, control, protagonism, purity, popularity, superiority and validation to create space for acccountabilities, for response-abilities, for exiled capacities and for deeper intimacies;
9. It involves learning and unlearning, disarming and de-centering, dethroning and de-arrogantizing, detoxifying and decluttering, mourning, grieving and healing, digesting and metabolizing, seeing ourselves as cute and pathetic, so that the wider metabolism can breathe and move more easily within and around us;
10. It involves loosening our attachments to our self images and to what we think we want, so that we might instead step up, own up, clean up, grow up, wake up and show up to do what is really needed, whether or not it fits with our personal agendas.""

""Naia Trust is an animist steward of capital dedicated to creating the conditions on Earth for all beings to thrive. Our mission is to reunify humans as “nature” and to advance a worldview of interbeing.

Naia Trust invests with a philosophy: with every flow of capital, we enquire as to whether it may bring those it touches into a meaningful, engaged and potentially enchanting relationship with the more-than-human-world.

We are passionate about equipping human and ecological communities with inner and outer resilience, empowering them to live in dignity and act with agency within the context of the current polycrisis. This could manifest in qualities such as regenerative agricultural systems, thriving exuberances of biodiversity, the advancement of  scientific knowledge, empowered local governance systems, innovative jurisprudence models, and poetic spaces to breathe and heal.

It pains us to bear witness to the widening fault lines and rifts in our society; the ‘othering’ that arises from a psychology that perceives duality between self and world; the multiple planetary boundaries that we are treacherously exceeding; and underneath this all, a profound estrangement of humanity from a living, sentient and sacred Earth.

Yet amidst times of great upheaval rests extraordinary potential. The world is pregnant with narratives waiting to be written. Our hope is rooted in an active engagement with the world, despite unknowable outcomes. We believe that what is ours to do is to help foster islands of coherence, tangible and embodied existence proofs that sow the seeds of cultures to come.""

Yet technologies that emerge from capitalist incentives too often fail to deliver on this promise. More often, they increase our capacity to pursue self-interest and externalize harm, exacerbating our deepest challenges rather than solving them.

So we need to look elsewhere – beyond capitalism and other conventional wisdom – to find real progress and deliver on technology’s true potential. We need better techniques for cooperating across difference: integrating our interests with others, making decisions together, and accepting the legitimacy of compromises.

RadicalxChange focuses on the details of how to do this, with particular attention to institutional innovation:

- Research: We support and contribute to rigorous research and development of novel decision-making and power-sharing systems, such as quadratic voting & funding, common ownership structures, plural currencies, social identity, and “listening-at-scale” citizen engagement techniques.
- Prototypes: We develop open-source technologies, such as our quadratic voting tool, RxC Voice, and PCOArt, that enable dynamic experimentation and illustrate promising new directions in institutional design.
- Partnerships: We work hand-in-hand with a wide variety of institutions, ranging from governments to arts institutions to data unions and web3 networks, to facilitate careful real-world implementations of boundary-pushing systems.
- Movement-Building: We educate the public and host events to weave surprising coalitions that can help grow the movement for plural innovation and democratic revitalization.

The aim of this research is to increase our ability to take into account the many relationships that coexist in any context of living things.

The International Bateson Institute generates and gives access to information that offers a wider vision. The focus of IBI inquiry is on the interrelational dynamics between and interdepencies among systems.

The IBI research involves recognizing how patterns repeat and reflect each other across multiple contexts and across multiple systems – understanding these systems’ maintenance and renewal will be critical in the coming decades.

The underlying premise of the IBI is to address and experiment with how we perceive. Our mandate is to look in other ways so that we might find other species of information and new patterns of connection not visible through current methodologies. We call this information “Warm Data.”""

We believe that holding an open-hearted and interdisciplinary space of dialogue is in itself a radical, ethical mode of being-in-the-world, which generates new pathways of research and collective sense-making with transformative potential.

MLE is a multidisciplinary laboratory for investigating the nature of experience — personal and collective, “first-person” and “third-person,” intersubjective and intrasubjective. We are inspired by cutting-edge theoretical frameworks and methodologies that have grown out of the enactive approach, which takes seriously the continuity between life and mind, body and cognition, theory and practice, and epistemology and ethics. Our aim is to develop practices that surpass the limits of orthodox mind science and advance more nuanced and comprehensive understandings of our minds, the world, and human interactions.

MLE provides a meeting ground for contemplative scientists who undertake the scientific study of contemplative practices, and/or approach scientific disciplines through a contemplative lens, with the intention of facilitating positive transformation in academia and the wider world. The field as a whole is indebted to the paradigm of neurophenomenology, first laid out by our founder Francisco Varela, which seeks to put back into conversation (circulation) third-person observations, first-person experience, second-person perspectives, and the space of intersubjectivity. This presupposes a non-dualist stance towards understanding the workings of the mind in relation to classical science, to what we call the “world,” and to social interactions of all kinds.""

Using Greece as a sandbox, we’re out to create a legacy that resonates through the ages: a renaissance of humanity.

We believe that humanity’s endeavours have become too far removed from values that are in harmony with the personal and greater good. We also believe that it’s down to us to rewrite the rules of life. After all, humans are unique in that ‘we are able to create physical instantiations of the objects we imagine. Whereas other species are stuck with nature’s inventory.’ (César Hidalgo). You can also think of us as change by the masses, for the masses.

A TIME FOR HEROIC ACTION
We also believe that in this Age of Crisis, only big ideas can tackle big challenges. That’s why everything we do is designed for global, but conceived for local – and personal. Critical in our endeavour are a fascination with life, generosity of spirit, and love of honour (‘filotimo’). Qualities that created the ancient Greek legacy the world reveres today. Join us as we kindle a flame in the darkness. And reignite Greece as a beacon of civilisation.

SOME OF OUR KEY AIMS?
Drawing on the evolutionary power of the imagination to redefine how society operates, offering humanity realistic hope for the future, and celebrating the positive things to come. But to achieve all this, it will take the many acting as one. Read on to explore our main change initiatives.""

We are scholars, artists, activists, futurists and seekers who believe credible hope for the first truly planetary civilisation lies in forms of economic restraint and political cooperation that are beyond prevailing epistemic capacities and spiritual sensibilities.

Our charitable purpose is therefore to develop an applied philosophy of education for individual and collective realisation in the service of averting societal collapse; and in the spirit of serious play and ambitious humility to cultivate the imaginative and emotional capacity required to usher in a world that is, at the very least, technologically wise and ecologically sound.

We believe the world’s major challenges stem from a crisis of perception and imagination, and the failure of political culture to honour the fullness of reality. We are fascinated by the myriad ways in which our tacitly held worldviews shape our judgement, and how spiritual needs for security, meaning and purpose indirectly create political and economic outcomes.""
